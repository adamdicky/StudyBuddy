My 2nd year Internet Programming subject project.
While it is not fully finished in terms of the UIUX and data operations, I am proud of this project that I have made with my groupmates. It is the first working web application that integrate with data operation.
In terms of data operation: 

1. Teacher can CRUD homeworks.
2. Admin can CRUD users.
3. Student can Update homework, by submitting a line of text as a submission.
